 * 		Week 11: Multithreading
 *		Write a program where 3 separate threads simulate flipping a coin. 
 *		The 3 threads should execute concurrently and each thread should do 1000 flips. 
 *		Keep track of what is currently the record number of consecutive heads/tails (separately) 
 *		and which thread produced that sequence. Every time a thread produces a longer sequence, 
 *		display a message on the screen. Make sure other threads canâ€™t interfere when updating the current record.
